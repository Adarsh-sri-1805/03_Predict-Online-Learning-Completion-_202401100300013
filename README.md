# 03_Predict-Online-Learning-Completion-_202401100300013
This project aims to Classify whether a learner will complete an online course based on activity logs using Python.
"Develop a predictive model to classify whether a learner will complete an online course based on their activity logs, including videos watched, assignments submitted, and forum posts. Leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and behaviors, providing an accurate prediction of success or failure. Your model will unveil key insights into learner engagement, helping online education platforms identify at-risk students and take proactive steps to boost completion rates.
